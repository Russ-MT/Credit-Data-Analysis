# Credit-Data-Analysis

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze credit risk data and understand the factors influencing credit behavior across various regions. By examining the relationships between credit balances, income levels, and other determinants, we uncover valuable insights into the drivers of credit risk.

Key aspects of the project include:

Coefficients of Independent Variables: Determining the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable.
Income & Beta Value Comparison: Analyzing how the beta values of credit risk vary with income across different regions.
Interaction Effects: Investigating the interaction between multiple credit balance determinants and their combined effect on credit risk.
Risk Score Calculation: Introducing a method to calculate risk scores and categorize them into various risk levels based on specific data features.
Files Included
Credit_Risk_Analysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook that contains all the analysis, visualizations, and code.
data.csv: The dataset used for the analysis (or specify your dataset if it's linked to an external source).
Requirements
The following libraries are used in this project:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

How to Run the Project
Clone the repository or download the notebook file and data.
Open the Credit_Risk_Analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or JupyterLab.
Run the notebook cells sequentially to load the dataset, perform the analysis, and generate the visualizations.
Review the insights and findings from the analyses.
Key Findings:
The independent variables with the largest coefficients significantly influence the dependent variable, shedding light on the primary drivers of credit risk.
The relationship between credit coefficients and regional income levels was found to be strong, suggesting that income has a crucial role in determining credit behavior.
Interaction effects between income and student-related factors provide further insight into how specific populations may impact credit risk.
Risk scores were calculated and classified into risk levels, offering a method for further decision-making and risk assessments.
Future Work
Refine the model by including additional features or considering non-linear relationships.
Explore deeper into regional differences and their effect on credit risk.
Investigate other types of credit risk models, including machine learning approaches, to improve predictive capabilities.
